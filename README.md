# TaxLedger

Modular tax calculation system for cryptocurrency transactions, starting with Swedish tax rules.

## Motivation
Cryptocurrency transactions must be declared yearly in many countries.
In Sweden, individuals are required to report profits and losses for each taxable crypto event.
This project aims to simplify that process by transforming transaction data into declaration-ready output.

## Scope (Initial Version)
- Import transaction data from CSV files
- Normalize and validate transactions
- Apply Swedish tax rules for crypto assets
- Calculate taxable events, gains, and losses
- Export results as CSV (PDF later)
